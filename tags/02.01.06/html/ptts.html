    <b>Simple text to speech command line program</b> 
    <p>
      This is a very simple Microsoft Windows script to convert
      text to speech. If uses the windows scripting host and the Microsoft Text to Speech
      Engine. The Text to Speech Engine is installed with Windows
      XP and later versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Linux or CYGWIN installations, there is a script file
      (ptts.sh) which provides everything here but supports many
      speech engines and languages. Run ptts.sh --help to get
      information on it. Note that under Linux the Microsoft
      speech engine will not work, another speech engine must be
      installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text can be keyed in or read from a text file. The
      sound can be output to the computer sound system or sent to
      a wave file. Text is read from standard input or can be
      read from a file using a redirect, for example, to read
      aloud a text file:<br>
       cscript "C:\Program Files\Jampal\ptts.vbs" &lt;
      war-and-peace.txt
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a wav file from the text file (e.g create an
      audio book ;) ):<br>
       cscript "C:\Program Files\Jampal\ptts.vbs" -w
      war-and-peace.wav &lt; war-and-peace.txt
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the speech and voice defaults using the speech
      control panel option.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are running 64-bit windows you may only see 64-bit
      voices. If you have 32-bit voices you can access them by
      running<br>
       c:\windows\syswow64\cscript "C:\Program
      Files\Jampal\ptts.vbs"
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Usage</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Typing the command<br>
       cscript "C:\Program Files\Jampal\ptts.vbs" -h<br>
       will list out the available options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage: cscript "C:\Program Files\Jampal\ptts.vbs" [options]
