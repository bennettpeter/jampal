          <b>Customizing Jampal</b>
          <p>
            The easiest customization is done by creating your library from one
            of the predefined templates. By using the "New Library" menu you
            can select a template for the library type you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can create extra playlists just be using Library Open,
            specifying a new file name and selecting Basic Playlist as the
            template. Playlists can be customized the same way that libraries
            can be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further customization of your library and of the system can be done
            from the "Edit", "Customize" menu.

            <i>Audio Gain</i><br>
            This is a percentage value that is applied to the default java
            sound level. If you find that the sound level is too low or too
            high adjust this. To check the level, play a song with your system
            default player (e.g. Windows media player) and play the same song
            with Jampal. In the system media player set the volume to maximum
            and adjust to a good listening volume with the master volume
            control of your system. If jampal plays at a lower volume use a
            higher value in Audio Gain, and if it plays louder use a lower
            Audio Gain. Valid values are 1 to 2500.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Look and Feel</i><br>
            This is a list box that selects how the program windows display on
            your system. The list box contains the names of the standard
            options that come with java, and some third party looks form
            various sources. See <a href="license.html">License &amp;
            acknowledgements</a>. The standard Java looks are at the top of the
            list. The selection will vary depending on your hardware, software
            and the version of Java. The "Napkin" look is intended to look like
            it was scribbled on a napkin and to get this effect it is best to
            reset the font selection. If you have selected a font, select
            "Edit", "Reset Font" to see the scribbled font that comes with
            "Napkin".
          </p>
          <p>
            You can download you own Java Look from the internet. If you do
            this, install the jar file for the look-and-feel in your java
            jre/lib/ext directory, and type the name of the class into the
            "look-and-feel" listbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be aware that in many cases downloaded or non standard looks
            may be CPU intensive or may cause problems. In some cases they may
            cause skipping during playback. If this happens or the system
            behaves erratically try switching back to a standard Java look.
            Please let me know if this happens or you have any problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Mixer Name</i><br>
            You can select which mixer java uses for playing songs. Normally
            "Java Sound Audio Engine" provides the best quality. If this
            setting does not work or provides poor quality, you can select a
            different option from among the available mixers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Speech Rate</i><br>
            Specifies how fast the announcer speaks. 0 is the default, to speak
            slower use a negative number from -1 to -10. To speak faster use a
            positive number from 1 to 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Mbrola Program</i><br>
            If you wish to use mbrola voices with eSpeak, enter here the name
            of the mbrola program (normally mbrola). If it is not on the path
            the full program file path must be included. The mbrola program 
            is needed. The programs supplied with "mbrola tools for 
            windows" do not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you use mbrola voices with FreeTTS, the mbrola program must be
            at the Mbrola Path (next field) and must have a program name of
            mbrola.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Mbrola Path</i><br>
            If you wish to use mbrola voices with FreeTTS or eSpeak, enter here
            the path where mbrola is installed. Voices must be installed in
            subdirectories of that path. Mbrola and voices can be downloaded
            free of charge from the <a href=
            "http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html">MBROLA Project</a>
            To use mbrola with FreeTTS you must also copy the mbrola.jar file
            as described on the <a href=
            "http://freetts.sourceforge.net">FreeTTS Web Site</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Cepstral Path</i><br>
            If you use Cepstral as a speech engine for any languages, you must
            enter the path where it is installed.
            <p>
            If you have purchased the Windows version of Cepstral and have decided
            to switch to Linux but do not want to pay for Cepstral again you can 
            install wine and install Cepstral under wine. Then 
            type wine: in front of the path, and jampal will invoke it with wine. For example type this:
            <code>wine:/home/yourname/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Cepstral</code>
            <p>
            If you find that the announcement works on only the first song, make sure 
            that you have not seleced Continuous Plyaing in the Play menu
            and specify a "Wait Before Speech" value of 5000.
            <p>
            The preferred way to use Cepstral is to purchase a Linux version.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>ESpeak Program</i><br>
            If you use ESpeak as a speech engine for any languages, you must
            enter the program name. If it is not on the path the full program
            file path must be included.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>espeak-data Path</i><br>
            If you use ESpeak as a speech engine for any languages, you must
            enter the location of the espeak-data directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Wait Before Speech</i><br>
            Specifying a value here will cause the program to pause the specified
            number of milliseconds before generating speech. When using Cepstral
            for Windows with wine it may be necessary to specify a value of 
            around 5000 here, otherwise only the first song may be announced.

            <i>Language</i><br>
            Here you can select voices for announcements in each language in
            which a song may be sung. The voice is selected based on the
            "Languages" tag of the song. More than one langauage can be
            selected for a song. The last language in the list is used for the
            announcement. You can also select a voice for songs with no
            language selected (select blank) and a voice for songs with other
            languages (select "other").
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Speech Engine</i><br>
            Here you can select from Microsoft, FreeTTS, Cepstral, eSpeak, or
            none. This specifies which speech engine will be used for song
            announcements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>ESpeak</i> This is a free speech system which can be downloaded
            from <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net">sourceforge</a>. It
            supports a large number of languages and many voices, including
            mbrola voices. It runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux and other
            environments. Some Linux systems install it automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Microsoft</i> This only works on Microsoft Windows systems with
            Microsoft TTS installed. Windows XP and above has this pre-installed. 
            You can adjust the voice and speeed in the Windows Control
            Panel. You can purchase or download voices that support Microsoft
            speech systems. Normally one or two voices come built in with
            Microsoft systems. Microsoft speech engine will currently not
            work with 64bit java. It will work with 64bit windows running 32bit Java.
          </p>
          <!--p>
            <i>FreeTTS</i> This is a free java speech system. This works on all
            platforms. Please go to the <a href=
            "http://freetts.sourceforge.net">FreeTTS Web Site</a> to download
            and install FreeTTS. For FreeTTS to work with jampal it must be
            installed in a directory called "freetts" that is next to the
            jampal install directory. (Or you can create a directory soft link
            at that location). For example if jampal is installed in c:\Program
            Files\Jampal, freetts must be installed in c:\Program
            Files\FreeTTS. On Linux if Jampal is installed in /usr/local/jampal
            you can create a link /usr/local/freetts to the directory where
            FreeTTS is installed. (Tip - to create a directory soft link under
            Windows, use the JUNCTION program from <a href=
            "http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Junction.html">SysInternals</a>.
            You can also use Mbrola voices with FreeTTS on all platforms. See
            mbrola path description above. FreeTTS only supports English with a
            few voices of mediocre quality.

          <p>
            <i>Cepstral</i> This is a commercial speech synthesis system
            available for many platforms and many languages. You can download a
            trial voice and purchase a license from <a href=
            "www.cepstral.com">Cepstral</a>. This works on Windows, Linux and
            Macintosh. The voices are high quality than the other speech
            engines. Please test the trial version to make sure it works to
            your satisfaction before purchasing any voices.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Voice</i><br>
            Depending on which speech engine you selected, this displays a list
            of available voices. If you want to select a default voice, select
            blank. If the engine you selected is eSpeak and the voice you
            selected is blank, a voice will automatically be selected based on
            the language. eSpeak voices that start mb- are mbrola voices. These
            only display here if you have installed them and given the correct
            value for the mbrola directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Speech Volume</i><br>
            Specifies the volume as a percentage of normal (i.e. 100 is
            normal). With some engines you can go above 100% but if you go too
            high the sound will be distorted. With others any value above 100
            is treated the same as 100. Mbrola voices are rather faint so you
            may need to specify 500 or 1000 to get a good volume. Mbrola voices
            with eSpeak will support values here up to the java maximum (2500
            or 1000 depending on the mixer selected). Non-mbrola eSpeak voices
            are rather loud. Non-mbrola eSpeak voices will not support any
            value above 200.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Test</i><br>
            You can test the currently selected row. It will read the text from
            the input area next to the test button. If the selected row has
            language "other" it will assume no language.

            Settings for the current library are changed here.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Announcement Template</i><br>
            This provides a template for the song announcements. This defaults
            to "(TITLE). (ARTIST)", but can be changed to include any values
            that are present in the tag. You can type words to be spoken but if
            you have more than one song language do not include any words here.
            They will be pronounced incorrectly in other languages. Anything
            specified within parentheses () must be the name of a field or
            frame. The same abbreviations are used as are used for <a href=
            "tagupdate.html">TagUpdate</a>. For ID3V2TAG frames use a space and
            the frame identifier, for example (ID3V2TAG COMMengMy Comment) to
            announce the comments frame that is English with the description
            "My Comment". Additionally any of the values specified below for
            the type column of the "Library Fields" tab can be used, except
            DUMMY.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Speech Replacement</i><br>
            You can further modify the announcement by specifying one or more
            regular expressions with replacements. The first box can have one
            or more regular expressions separated by slashes. The second box
            has the same number of strings separated by slashes. In sequence,
            each regular expression will be replaced by its substitute before
            the song is announced.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Use Unix Style Paths</i><br>
            If this is checked, the library will store all file names
            unix-style, with no drive letter and with forward slashes. If you
            are running Windows, this only makes sense if all your music files
            are on the same logical drive. As long as your startup shortcut has
            the startup directory on that same drive this will work. Advantages
            of using this are: (1) You can use a dual-boot windows and Linux
            system and have your library on a drive accessible to both. (2) You
            can share your library over a network where the drive may be linked
            with a different drive letter on different machines. (3) You can
            use the mp3 file management shell scripts under CYGWIN. If you are
            running Linux, Unix or Macintosh, this parameter will be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Mp3 File Names Are Case Sensitive</i><br>
            In Windows, file names are not case sensitive. If you try to create
            have two files named "RAY OF LIGHT.mp3" and "ray of light.mp3" in
            the same directory, the system will not allow you to do that, the
            second file will overwrite the first. In Unix, however, you can
            have these two files plus "Ray of light.mp3", "Ray Of Light.mp3"
            and other combinations, and all are different files. Jampal assumes
            that when running Unix that file names are case sensitive, and when
            running other operating systems they are not. However, if you are
            running Linux and have a FAT file system mounted, the file names
            will not be case sensitive and you should change this parameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Values are "Yes" (file names are case sensitive), "No", (they are
            not), and "Default" which will use the operating system default
            (Yes for Unix, No for Windows and others).
          </p>
          <p>
            This value is only used if you are adding to the library a file
            which differs only in case from a file already in the library.
            Jampal uses this to determine whether the new file is additional or
            replacing the previous file.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Library Type</i><br>
            This identifies whether this is a Playlist or a Library.
            Differences are:<br>
            <b>Playlist:</b> When playing songs and reaching the end of a song
            it skips to the next song. Also takes into account the "follow"
            option (See <a href="playlist.html">Playlist Window</a>).<br>
            <b>Library:</b> Asks for confirmation before clearing library or
            deleting tracks.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Library Index Data File Name</i><br>
            This is the name of the file where the actual track data is stored.
            It is normally set to the name of the library, followed by ".jmp".
            You can specify any other name if you wish. Normally the file will
            be stored in the same directory as the library, however you can
            specify a directory name here if you wish to store it elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you change the name, Jampal will not attempt to move the data
            to the new library data file. If that file already exists it will
            be loaded into Jampal. If it does not yet exist, Jampal will show
            an empty list.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can have two libraries pointing to the same list of tracks by
            using the same file name for both. This will only work if the
            library fields are the same (see the Library Fields tab below).
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Playlist Name</i><br>
            This is the name of the playlist that is used when you use the
            "open playlist" or "add tracks to playlist" menus. This must be the
            name of a valid jampal library or else you will get an error when
            trying to open the playlist. You can create a new playlist and then
            enter its name here to make it the default playlist. Note that you
            can have as many playlists as you wish, and open them with the
            "open library" menu. The "Playlist name" option only controls which
            one is opened with the "open playlist" menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Window Style for this Library</i><br>
            If you specify "Normal" there is space allowed for displaying a
            track name in the top of the window to the left of the slider and
            the slider is larger. If you specify "Compact" the slider is
            smaller and the track playing name is only displayed in the title
            bar. By default libraries have "normal" and playlists have

            <i>Resize Mode</i><br>
            This is a list of options which control what happens to column
            sizes if you resize the window or resize a column. The default is
            "off" which does not automatically resize columns and provides a
            horizontal scroll bar. If you don't like that behaviour try the
            other options until you find one you like.

            This page controls the field values that are stored on the library
            index data file. The file is a tab delimited text file. This means
            you can load it into a spreadsheet program to manipulate a list of
            your tracks. You can select fields from the track tags to be stored
            in your library. Any values that you want displayed on the screen
            in the library grid must be included here, but not all values here
            need to be displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the columns show list boxes when you click them. If some
            names in the list box are cut short you can either make the column
            larger by dragging its border in the title, or you can make the
            window wider by dragging its edge.

                the serach field by spaces (e.g. use " APIC" to search for

                automatically inserted into the album column. You should make
                sure ALBUM is one of the selected columns if you are using this

          </table>If you specify DUMMY fields in your library, these can be
          displayed in the library or playlist window. You can type any value
          you wish into these fields and use them for sorting. The values will
          not be stored on the mp3 file. I do not recommend this for important
          information as it will be lost if your library is deleted or
          corrupted. For important information use a text field as described
          below as a custom field. Dummy fields could be used for a temporary
          sort key or similar.
          <p>
            <i>Frame</i><br>
            If you select type ID3V2TAG, you can select a frame name here.
            There are many frames that can be stored on an mp3 file. Select
            which you want stored in the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="tables.html#frame_table">" See list of supported
            frames.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that Images (Attached Picture) cannot be selected for storage
            in the library. Also if you select a multiple line text field, only
            the first line is stored in the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Language</i><br>
            Some frames require a language code. When a frame includes a
            language code you can have many frames with that name and different
            languages. For example you can have comments in English, plus
            comments in French plus comments in Spanish etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will have a list box of languages to select from if the frame
            requires a language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Description</i><br>
            Some frames allow a description. In that case you can have many
            frames with that name and different descriptions, for example you
            can have user-defined text with description John for John's rating
            of the song, and user-defined text with description Mary for Mary's
            rating of the song.
          </p>
          <p>
            In cases where there are both a language and a description the
            possibilities are endless, you can have each description repeated
            with each language to create an endless number of values in your
            song.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Title</i><br>
            This is the title you want displayed if this value is displayed in
            the library window.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Add Button</i><br>
            Adds an entry to the table, after the currently selected row, or at
            the end if no row is selected. Initially it is shown as "user
            defined text", but you can change it to any desired frame type.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Delete Button</i><br>
            Deletes the current selected row.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Move Up and Move Down Button</i><br>
            Moves the currently selected row. This changes how the data are
            stored on the library because they are stored in the same sequence
            on the library as in this table. Moving items here does not affect
            how they are displayed, that is selected in the "Display Columns"
            tab.

            All of the entries in the previous tab are shown here. Here you can
            rearrange the order in which they are displayed in Jampal when you
            open the library, and select which entries from the library are
            displayed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only options here are to move the selected row up or down, and
            to check or uncheck each row. Rows that are checked are displayed
            in the library window.

            This page defines what values are automatically displayed on the

            values that already exist on the mp3 tag. The fields that you
            select on this page are always displayed for you to edit, even if
            there is no existing value in the mp3 file.

          <p>
            If there are some fields that you use often, you can include them
            here so that it is easy to fill them in. Even if you did not select
            a field here, you can still add any field you wish, using the
            "Create Additional Frame" button. You should always include the
            basic fields, title, album, artist. For information on how to
            complete the fields on this page please refer to the description of
            the Library tab above. On this page you can select images, which
            cannot be selected in the Library tab. You cannot include
            information types such as bit rate, because these cannot be
            updated.
