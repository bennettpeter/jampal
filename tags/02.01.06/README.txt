This is a list of the new features and changes in Jampal 

jampal (02.01.06)

  * Cepstral and wine

  Windows versions of Cepstral voices can be used with wine, by specifying wine:
  in front of the Cepstral path and using a "Wait before speech" setting of
  5000.

  * Freetts

  Support for freetts speech generation has been removed. Testing with Ubuntu
  did not work and caused the program to hang. The other engines have better
  sound and more options anyway.

  * Looks under Ubuntu

  Support jgoodies and squareness looks if they are installed via Ubuntu
  Software Center. (install jgoodies or sqaureness from technical option in
  Ubuntu Software center)

  * Load Playlist From File

  Fixed bug where a null pointer exception message displayed when loading an m3j
  playlist.

  * Help file under Ubuntu

  The help file was not displayed under Ubuntu or any platform that does not
  support the Desktop API. Fixed so that it can use the default browser if the
  desktop API is not available.

  * envelope command with playlists

  If the envelope command was used with a playlist generated by the playlist
  command, album names were not printed under certain circumstances.

  * tagbkup

  In some cases, the program would report "Warning - no tag on file xxxx"
  incorrectly, when there was a tag. This did not affect the processing. The
  problem has been fixed.

  * Default customization

  In the customization dialog, automatically supply the default mixer.

  * Default Speech Engine

  If Play Announcements is requested and no speech engine or voice is selected,
  Jampal will use a default engine.

jampal (02.01.05)

  * ptts

    The ptts.exe utility has been rewritten. It is now a vbs script, run
    with the cscript command. It now supports windows 32 bit as well
    as 64 bit versions and voices.

  * Announcements

    Announcements using the windows speech engine are now fixed to work with
    32 bit and 64 bit JVM, and support 32 bit and 64 bit voices.

jampal (02.01.04)

  * Memory leak

    Fixed memory leak that occurs when closing a library or making certain
    changes with the edit-customize dialog.

  * Man pages

    Added clarification about requirement for lame and Libre Office.

  * Error Handling

    Improved error handling for when components are not installed, and for
    commands run against an empty library.

jampal (02.01.04)

* Debian support
Moving debian directory out of the source archive to make sure this is not
a native debian package.

64 Bit Linux Support
A 64 bit linux version of tagbkup is now included. Both 32 bit and 64 bit versions are in the install package so that it can be installed on 32 bit or 64 bit Linux systems. The same java versions of the jampal program work in 32 bit or 64 bit Linux. 

Version 1.23 

64 Bit Support
The install script is updated so that Jampal will support a 32bit or 64bit version of Java on 64bit Windows systems. If a 64bit Java is used, announcements using the Microsoft speech engine currently will not work. Other speech options will work. 

Icons and files
There is a new icon for Jampal. Also jampal libraries will show the icon in Windows explorer, and you can open the library by double clicking the library icon.
