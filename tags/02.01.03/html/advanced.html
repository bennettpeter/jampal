            <b>Playlists</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can create extra playlists just be using Library Open,
            specifying a new file name and selecting Basic Playlist as the
            template. Playlists can be customized the same way that libraries
            can be.

            <b>Accessing the library from other programs</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can open the library.jmp file with a spreadsheet or text
            editor. You will see the values as described in the library.jampal
            file, with the exception of the first column which contains '0'. If
            Jampal is currently open you should select "Save Library" before
            opening it with another program to ensure that any changes you have
            made are merged into the library. If you fail to do this you may
            see duplicate items and items which have been deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Multi User</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            A jampal library can be on a shared drive and accessed and updated
            by more than one person at once. Updates done by others will only
            be seen when restarting the program or using the "Reload Library"
            option from the file menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Multi Tasking</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can update a tag while a file is playing. In rare occasions
            where the file is playing on another machine the update may fail.
            In this case trying it again normally works.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you update a tag in one window it will show the update in all
            libraries open on the desktop at that time. This only works if all
            libraries have been opened in the same java vm, i.e. open libraries
            from the file menu, do not launch the application a second time
            from the program menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Read Only Library or Playlist</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the "jmp" file is read-only, you can play the songs and reorder
            the library. Any attempt to update a tag or the library will give
            an error message that the library is read-only. This can be useful
            if you want to prevent people updating your library or tags.
          </p>
