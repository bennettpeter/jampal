            <b>General</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This window is opened from the library or playlist. When it first
            opens it displays the details of any selected track, or the first
            of multiple tracks selected.
            <p>
            The window may open shorter or taller, depending on the number and size of 
            frames in the tag. If there is a lot of information it will have a 
            verical scroll bar. You can have an unlimited number of frames in 
            a tag so the window could be very tall. See the two examples above.
          </p>
          <p>
            While it is open you can still access the library. By clicking in
            the library window you can show the details of other tracks. The
            editor window dynamically updates to show the details of a new
            track selected, unless any check boxes next to fields have been
            checked.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Checkboxes</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each field has a checkbox at the left. Before you can modify a
            value you must select the checkbox. Once you have selected any
            checkbox on the page, the view is locked, changing the selection in
            the library no longer updates the display, so that you do not
            accidentally erase values you have keyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Blue Question Marks</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to each value is a blue question mark. Clicking this will open
            a window showing an explanation of the frame from the ID3V2
            standards document. To find explanations of frames not existing on
            the track, use the "Create Additional Frame" to add a frame, then
            click the blue question mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Description</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the checkboxes are sometimes space for another field to be
            entered. This is the "Description" field that is used by some
            frames in the ID3v2 standard. Depending on the tag id, by using
            different descriptions and languages you can have multiple versions
            of the same tag, for example the "Comments" tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Language</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the description there is in some cases a language. This is
            supported by certain ID3v2 frames to allow comments, lyrics and
            other items to be entered in more than one language.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Pictures</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The "Attached Picture" frame allows pictures to be added to a
            track. By entering different descriptions and different picture
            types you can attach as many pictures as you want to. Most pictures
            on mp3 files have a blank description and type of "other". There
            are load, save, and delete buttons attached to each picture. You
            can load a picture from a file, save it to a file or delete it from
            the track.
          </p>
          <p>
            The default picture with no description is set up as the first
            frame on the editor page. If there is no picture, a white space
            with the message "Drop Picture Here" will display.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can drop a new picture on to an existing picture to replace it
            or onto the white space marked "Drop Picture Here". You can drag it
            from an explorer window or from a browser (Internet Explorer)
            window.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Song Language</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you select the language tag to be visible on the track editor or
            you add it with "Create Additional Frame", you can select up to
            three languages for a song. This affects the announcements. The
            announcements use the last language selected, so if there are
            several languages in a song, set the last one in the list as the
            language most appropriate to the song title.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Alternate Album</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can add a prompt to your tag editor for Alternate Albums and
            tracks. You can enter here additional albums on which the song
            appears, followed by a colon and the track number on that album.
            After updating the tag extra entries will appear in the library
            showing the song under different albums. The extra entries will be
            identified in the library by a flag (<img src=
            "images/tiny_alt_album.png">) next to the album name. You can
            remove duplicate songs from your hard drive to save space and still
            have them visible in the library under each album.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Create Additional Frame</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            From the drop down list near the bottom of the window you can
            select a field name. Then by clicking the "Create Additional Frame"
            button that field will be added to the bottom of the window. You
            can then fill in its values for updating onto tracks. You can
            create an unlimited number of additional frames, either text or
            pictures. After creating a frame, if you decide not to use it,
            simply undo its check box.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Super Tagging</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you select this check box, you can type a delimiter into the
            text entry field next door. This delimiter is then used to split
            the file name into parts which can then be updated into the track
            tag. For example if your track's file name is "1 - Like a Prayer -
            Madonna.mp3", you can specify the delimiter as " - ". Then the
            first field is track number, second title, third artist. Type #1
            into the track number field on the screen, #2 into the title and #3
            into the artist. This is especially useful if you have a large
            number of tracks named according to the same method. They can all
            be updated in one go.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other values you can use if you select Super Tagging are #RAN to
            insert a random number between 1 and 99, or #DIR to use the
            directory name (last part only).
          </p>
          <p>
            If son titles, artists or any other value was typed into one or
            more songs in the wrong case (e.g. UPPER CASE or entirely lower
            case), you can repair one or more tags without retyping. Select
            Super Tagging and Type the value #TTL to convert the values to
            Title Case (Capital at the start of each word, lower case for the
            rest of the word).
          </p>
          <p>
            During super tagging some substitutions are made. This is to help
            with certain characters that are not permitted in file names.
          </p>

            <b>Fix Case</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a feature to repair values which have been keyed in UPPER
            CASE or entirely in lower case. If you select this check box, then
            all fields selected will be converted to "Title Case" (Each word
            starts with an uppercase letter). Any number of songs can be
            selected for this. Any values you have typed into the fields are
            ignored and pictures that have been placed on the page are not
            updated. This is equivalent to typing #TTL into the fields when
            using super tagging. However with super tagging you can update
            other fields with values at the same time, but with the "Fix Case"
            checkbox the only thing that is done when hitting the "Update"
            button is fixing the case of selected fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Refresh</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This button discards everything you have done and displays the
            values from the first track currently selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Update Tags</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This button goes through all tracks that are currently selected and
            applies updates to them all. Only values with the checkbox selected
            are updated. So for example you can select the album name field and
            select all tracks of that album. The name will be updated on all
            tracks. This is also useful for adding a picture to all tracks of
            an album. This is a powerful feature with many uses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Deleting values</i><br>
            To delete a value from one or more tracks, just clear the text
            value and update the tracks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Updating Language or description</i><br>
            If you update the language or description of a frame, you will find
            that you have two copies of it on your track, one with the old
            description and one with the new. You should then delete the one
            you do not want.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Duplicate Frames</i><br>
            If you add a frame, plus same language and description where
            applicable, that already exists, then whichever one has a check box
            will be written to tracks. If more than one of the same frame (plus
            language and description where applicable) are checked, the last
            one on the page will be used.
          </p>
