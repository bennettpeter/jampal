          <b>Media Files</b>
          <p>
            Jampal supports mp3 encoded audio files with ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags.
            If no tags exist on the files they will be added the first time a
            tag update is performed. There is no support for wav files, ogg
            vorbis, wma, etc. Any attempt to add files of these types to the
            library will result in an error message. Files can only be played
            once they have been added to a library or to a playlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>ID3 tags</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Jampal can successfully read all versions of ID3 tags: ID3v1,
            ID3v2.2, ID3v2.2.1, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4. It can read tags that are
            "unsynchronized" or "non-unsynchronized", and compressed tags. This
            is more comprehensive than most other programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jampal writes ID3v1 and ID3v2.3 tags (non-unsynchronized,
            non-compressed). These are the versions that almost all players
            support. If a file has a different version of tag or one that is
            compressed or unsynchronized, it will be converted the first time
            it is updated by Jampal. Also if there is only an ID3v1 or only an
            ID3v2 tag the other will be created the first time the tag is
            updated by Jampal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Library</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This program will store a library of any number of mp3 tracks that
            exist in any combination of directories or hard drives, including
            network drives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The library displays all tracks with selected fields in a table
            format. The table can be sorted on any column or combination of
            columns. The three major sort sequence columns are highlighted in
            the column header.
          </p>
          <p>
            Library columns can be rearranged by dragging from left to right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Library rows can be rearranged by dragging up or down, or by
            sorting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tracks can be edited from the library, directly in the grid or by
            opening a track editor window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drag and drop supports dragging files from the explorer or file
            manager into the library or into a playlist. It also allows
            dragging files from the library or playlist to another place within
            the application, to a directory on the hard drive, to other player
            software or to CD burning software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking on the title bar sorts tracks by any column. Multiple
            columns can be clicked to sort by multiple values for example track
            title within artist. The words "the" and "a" at the beginning of a
            title or artist name are ignored for sorting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typing the first few characters of a value sorted jumps to the
            closest matching entry in the list.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Track Editor Window</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags can be displayed and updated, using a track
            editor window. Many tracks can be updated in one operation, for
            example to place an album art picture on all tracks of an album.
          </p>
          <p>
            The editing window displays a fixed number of preferred fields
            first, then all other frames from the tag. Most values can be
            edited, and documentation on the meaning of each value can be
            displayed. One or more files can be updated at a time and "super
            tagging" can be applied to one or more files at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Super tagging feature allows updating any tag value(s) from the
            file name and file directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Audio Player</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Audio player controls exist at the top of the library window and
            also at the top of the playlist window. From the library you can
            play a single track, while the playlist will play all tracks in
            succession. Songs in the playlist can be played in any sequence or
            shuffled into random order.
          </p>
          <p>
            An option on the Edit menu allows you to turn on a synthesized
            voice announcement of song titles while playing in the library or
            playlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Playlist</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The playlist displays in a more compact format than the library
            with fewer details shown. It has all of the capabilities of the
            library, including editing, sorting, rearranging.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Customization</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Jampal can be customized in many ways, for example
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customize your library to store whatever values you wish.
            Customize your library view and playlist view.
            </li>
            <li>Create as many libraries as you wish.
            </li>
            <li>Create multiple views of the same library, each displaying
            different columns.
            </li>
            <li>Create Multiple playlists. The program will remember how far
            you have played in each one, even after a restart.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>Multi User</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Update tags while a song is playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Share the same library from multiple computers, and make updates
            from different computers without risk of losing data in the
            library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Data Sharing</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Jampal library is a tab-delimited text file with a format you
            can define. This means that you can open it with any text editor or
            spreadsheet program for any purpose. A Jampal library can be set up
            compatible with Musicmatch Jukebox, so that you can import a
            Musicmatch library into jampal or import a jampal library into
            Musicmatch.
          </p>
