      <b>Making the envelope</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    These are instructions for making an mp3 disk envelope after you
    have printed it using the "jampal envelope" command.
      These instructions are designed for USA letter sized paper
      (8.5 inches x 11 inches). If you are using A4 they may need
      some modification.

      Cut the index pages along the lines as shown below.

      Turn the envelope page (last page) over and make marks as
      shown below in red. The printing on the example below will
      not be visible, it will be on the underside of the paper.

    <p>
      Place a ruler on the page along the red lines marked fold
      1, fold 2, fold 3. In each case pull the paper up against
      the ruler to make a crease. Finally fold the right edge
      over to meet fold 1. This makes fold 4 (marked in blue).
