            <b>Selecting tracks</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Many options require you to first select one or more tracks in the
            library. Select one track by clicking it with the mouse or using
            the up or down keyboard arrow. Select many individual tracks by
            holding "control" and clicking them. Select a range by using
            "shift" and clicking them. If you sort the library or use
            "shuffle", your selection is lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            One cell of a selected row will display in default "unselected"
            colors. This shows the cell that can be edited using the "edit
            cell" option (see below).
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Open Library</i><br>
            This allows you to open an existing Jampal Library or to create a
            new one. It will present an "open" dialog where you can select a
            file with "jampal" extension to open an existing library, or type
            in any name to create a library. This will open a new window for
            the library (i.e. you will then have two library windows open).
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Add Tracks to Library</i><br>
            This presents an "open" dialog where you can either select one or
            more "mp3" files or select one or more directories. If you select
            mp3 files they will be added to the library. If you select
            directories, the directory and all directories under it will be
            scanned for mp3 files and they will be added to the library. All
            files will be added to the end of the library and then will be
            highlighted. If any of the tracks already exists in the library it
            will be moved to the end of the library with the others that are
            added. No track will appear twice in the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a checkbox on the right of the open dialog "Click here to
            remove ID3v2 tag". This is provided in case you have an mp3 file
            with corrupted tag. If you find when adding a particular file to
            the library or when using the tag editor on a particular file that
            you get an exception message or the program stops responding
            correctly, it may be a corrupted tag. Using this checkbox will
            remove existing ID3v2 information from the file and allow you to
            add it to the library and create a new tag. When selecting this
            checkbox you can only select one file at a time and cannot select a
            directory.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Open Playlist</i><br>
            This opens the playlist window and shows any titles already in the
            playlist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Save Playlist as file</i><br>
            You can save your playlist in two ways, as an "m3u" file or an
            "m3j" file.
          </p>
          <p>
            An "m3u" file stores the file names in your play list and can be
            used with jampal or many other players, for example you can open it
            with Microsoft Media Player or Musicmatch Jukebox.
          </p>
          <p>
            An "m3j" file stores only the song names and artists. The playlist
            can be opened and played with Jampal. This has the advantage that
            if files are later renamed or moved, they can still be played as
            long as they are still in your jampal library.
          </p>
          <p>
            A "save" dialog will open. After you enter an appropriate location
            and name, the current playlist will be saved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Load Playlist from file</i><br>
            An "open" dialog will open. You can select an existing m3u file or
            an m3j file. All songs referenced in that file will be added to the
            playlist after the first selected row and then will be highlighted.
            If there are any entries in the saved playlist more than once, only
            the last one of each duplicated name will be kept, the others will
            be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Save Library</i><br>
            Any updates, deletes, additions that you have made to the library
            will be merged into the library stored on disk. Note that this is
            done automatically upon closing the window. Also note that failure
            to save the library will not cause any updates to be lost even if
            the system fails. The only purpose behind saving the library is in
            case you want to read it into a spreadsheet or other program
            without first closing jampal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>File, Reload Library</i><br>
            The library is reloaded from disk. The only purpose of this is in
            case the library was updated by some external process. For example
            if you have a program that renames files on disk and updates the
            names of files in the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Add Tracks to Playlist</i><br>
            Before invoking this you must select one or more tracks in the
            library. These will be added to the end of the play list. If the
            playlist window is not already open it will be opened.
          </p>
          <p>

                Expression syntax is very powerful but somewhat arcane. For
                example to find titles that have no lowercase characters use
                this pattern: ^[^a-z]*$ with the case sensitive option
                unchecked. To find all titles that start with "man" and end
                with "dog": ^man.*dog$. If you want to match the entire string
                start the pattern with ^ and end it with $, otherwise it will
                match to any part of the string. For more information go

          </table>Below is an explanation which changes as you click different
          options.
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Edit Track Tags</i><br>
            Opens the <a href="editor.html"> track editor window </a> and shows the values applicable to
            any track selected, or the first track selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, View Track Properties</i><br>
            Opens a pop up window that displays technical data about the mp3
            file. Fields displayed are File Name, File Size, Mpeg Version, Bit
            Rate, Sample Rate, Channel Mode, Emphasis, Playing Time, Tag Size,
            Tag Type, Frames. This displays all frames in the track, unlike the
            library which only displays the id's of frames not already shown in
            the library. For a list of the meanings of frames look in the
            <a href="tables.html">Tables</a> and <a href="frames.html">ID3
            Frame Descriptions</a> sections of the help. Also if the Track
            Properties window is open and you change the track selection, the
            track properties window will dynamically update to show the new
            selected track.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Delete Tracks From Library</i><br>
            Deletes selected tracks from the library. Does not delete tracks
            from the hard drive. You can add them back at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Copy</i><br>
            Copies selected tracks to the clipboard. They can be pasted into
            Windows Explorer, or into the same library at a different place, or
            into another library or playlist, or into another application that
            accepts dropped files.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Paste</i><br>
            Paste into the library, files that have been copied in the same or
            another library, or files that have been copied from Windows
            Explorer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Validate Tracks</i><br>
            This will validate the selected tracks, making sure the mp3 files
            exist. If any are not found (i.e. they have been renamed) it
            searches through the parent library for matching title and update.
            The parent library is the library from which you opened the current
            library. This menu option can be used on a playlist or library
            containing songs that have been renamed in the main library.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the file did exist, it reloads the library from the song
            information, so if any changes were made outside of Jampal (with
            another program) this will refresh the Jampal library with those
            changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you play a song it also performs the search for a renamed song
            when the file is not found.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Clear Library</i><br>
            Clears the library. Does not delete tracks from the hard drive. You
            can add tracks to the library again at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Edit Cell</i><br>
            Edit the current selected cell directly in the grid. You can also
            do this with Ctrl-E or F2. The current selected cell is displayed
            in the deafult background color while the reset of the selected row
            is displayed in a different color. When data are edited in the grid
            you update the mp3 file as well as the library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Automatic Cell Editing</i><br>
            This works the same as clicking the Automatic Cell Editing
            Checkbox. See the description below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Combine Duplicates</i><br>
            If you have two copies of the same song from different albums, this
            can help save disk space. Sort the library by track name and artist name.
            If you find two, or more copies of the same song with different albums, 
            select all of the songs one at a time while holding the control button.
            Decide which one is the main album for that song (for example the album on 
            which it first appeared). Still holding the control button, unselect and 
            reselect that one (or just make sure you selected it last in the first place).
            Now you should see all of the songs highlighted and one will have the 
            "focus" rectangle.<p>
            <img src="images/select_duplicate.jpg" hspace="10"><p>
            Then select the "Edit, Combine Duplicates" menu and it will create 
            "alternate albums" and mark the unwanted copies with D in the Jampal
            column.<p>
            <img src="images/combined_result.jpg" hspace="10"><p>
            Before doing this you must add the *JAMPAL field to your library. 
            Tracks which are marked with D are shown struck out.<p>
            This can be used in conjunction with the "mp3dup.sh" script which
            finds duplicate or potential duplicate songs and creates a separate
            library for them. The mp3lib.sh script can move the tracks marked with D
            to a directory for trash songs. You can manually review them before finally
            deleting them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Customize</i><br>
            Customize your library. See the full description on the <a href=
            "customization.html">Customization page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Edit, Font</i><br>
            Select the font used for displaying and inputting track
            information. Use this when you have tracks with non-English
            characters that do not display in the default font.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Play/Pause</i><br>
            Equivalent to clicking the play button if nothing is playing in
            this window, or the pause button if it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Stop</i><br>
            Equivalent to clicking the stop button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Previous</i><br>
            Equivalent to clicking the back button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Next</i><br>
            Equivalent to clicking the forward button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Shuffle</i><br>
            Equivalent to clicking the Shuffle button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Announcements</i><br>
            Activates a synthesized announcement of before each song is played.
            By default this is title and artist but this can be customzed. This
            works on certain systems with a speech generation engine installed.
            Many speech engines are supported.
            You can customize the speech engine 
            with the <a href="customization.html">"customization"</a> feature.
            <p>
            You can announce your song titles in the language
            that matches the song name. There is a Voices tab in the
            configuration dialog that allows you to select voices to be used
            with each song language. You can select for each language which
            engine and voice will be used.
            <p>
            You can assign more than one language to a song. This will be
            useful if the language for the announcement should be different
            from the main laguange for the song. Announcements use the last language
            in the list.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play, Continuous</i><br>
            In a playlist this plays songs without a break between one and the
            next. In both the playlist and the library this will cause
            announcements to overlap the music and to avoid gaps between one
            track and the next.

            This is the same as selecting "Automatic Cell Editing" from the
            Edit menu. (See <i>Edit, Edit Cell</i> above). If this is checked,
            some functions in Jampal change. In the table of songs, the cell
            that is selected will automatically be edited. Only editable fields
            are edited (values like Bit Rate or Playing Time cannot be edited).
            To update many songs or fields all you need to do is type into the
            table and tab from one field to another. This avoids the need to
            press F2 or select "edit cell" to edit a cell. In this mode of
            operation some features are unavailable. Searching on the sort
            field by typing the start of a name is not available, and double
            clicking a song to play is not available. Note that to update many
            songs with a constant value (e.g. to update the album name on 14
            songs) it is easier to select multiple songs and use the tag editor
            rather than pasting into the cells on the library page.

            <i>Play Time</i><br>
            The time played in this song followed by the total length of the
            song, both in minutes and seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Slider</i><br>
            Shows the progress of playing this song. You can drag this to a new
            location to skip to a different place in the song.

            <i>Shuffle</i><br>
            Sorts Library into random sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Title Row</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The title for each column is shown here. The columns can be
            customized (see <a href="customize.html">Customization</a>). The
            columns marked A, B, C are customized fields you can use for any
            purpose, or you can customize them with your own names.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Resizing</i><br>
            Columns can be resized by dragging the line between columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Sorting</i><br>
            Clicking on the header for a column sorts the list on that column.
            Clicking on another column then sorts on the second column while
            retaining the previous sort. So for example if you click first on
            title then on artist you will have it sorted by title within
            artist. A triangle indicates the sort column and smaller triangles
            indicate the two prior sort columns. Clinging a column a second
            time reverses the sort order. The sort ignores "the" and "a" and
            parenthesized text at the beginning of titles or artists.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Moving Columns</i><br>
            Columns can be dragged left or right to change the order of
            columns. This change is temporary, it will revert next time the
            library is opened.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Table Data</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Alternate Album</i><br>
            Jampal is able to identify tracks that exist in two or more albums,
            even when there is only one copy of the song on the hard drive.
            Additional entries in the library are identified by a CD with an arrow
            <img src="images/cd_go.png"> next to the album. Songs which have 
            additional album entries are identofied by a CD <img src="images/cd.png">
            next to the album. See the "combine duplicates" menu item described above and 
            <a href="editor.html">Track Editor Window</a> for details.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Search</i><br>
            If the table has been sorted (triangle displayed in a header),
            click in the table and start typing the first few letters in the
            beginning of an entry to quickly jump to a place within the table.
            The text that you are typing is displayed in the status bar at the
            bottom. If you want to start a new search, press Escape and start
            typing again. When searching in this manner it ignores diacritics
            and upper case characters. If searching on a title or artist column
            it also ignores leading "a", "the", special characters and
            parenthesized text. The backspace key can be used to correct errors
            while typing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Cell Editing</i><br>
            To edit without opening the tag editor, click in any cell or use
            the arrows to get there, press F2 or Ctrl-E and start typing to
            update the tag data. Not all cells can be edited: file name,
            playing time and bit rate are examples of cells that cannot be
            updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Pop Up Menu</i><br>
            The table data has a pop-up menu containing the following items.
            These behave the same as the similarly named items in the File and
            Edit menus.<br>
            Add Tracks to Playlist<br>
            Edit Track Tags<br>
            View Track Properties<br>
            Delete Tracks From Library<br>
            Copy<br>
            Paste<br>
            Validate Tracks<br>
            Clear Library<br>
            Clear Last Playing Indicator
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Drag and Drop</i><br>
            You can select any number of items in the list and drag them to
            another location. To do this first select the files, then release
            the mouse, move it slightly, click on one of the selected items and
            drag. Drag to another place in the same list to reorder files; drag
            to a folder in the explorer/ file manager window to copy the files
            to a new directory; drag to another jampal library that is open to
            copy into that library; drag to an open playlist; drag to another
            player program (e.g. winamp, windows media player); drag to a CD
            burner software window to record them to CD.
          </p>
          <p>
            When dragging to a Jampal window they will be inserted after the
            row you point at; to insert at the start of the list, drag to the
            header row, to insert at the end of the list drag to the last row
            or to the status line at the bottom of the window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Copy and Paste can be used the same way, either with the menu
            items, or the keyboard shortcuts, Control-C and Control-V.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Play</i><br>
            If you double click a song in the list it plays, the same as if you
            had clicked the "Play" Button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Status Row</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The status row at the bottom of the window displays the number of
            tracks selected, the total playing time in days, hours, minutes,
            seconds, as well as the total file size in Kilobytes. Also it
            displays the number of files. If there are duplicate songs selected
            (i.e. the same file in two or more songs), the number of files and
            files size exclude the duplicates. Duplicates can occur because of
            "Alternate Albums" or can occur in a playlist because the same
            track has been added more than once.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is useful to find out how many songs you have by a particular
            artist or how many songs are in the library (to select all use
            Control-A). The total playing time and total file size only display
            if the playing time and file size are selected in the library
            fields in the customization dialog.
          </p>
