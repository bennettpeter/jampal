            <b>Log files</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the program fails to respond or responds incorrectly, there may
            be helpful information in the log files. The log files are located
            in your home directory, subdirectory ".jampal". There are two
            files, jampal_err.txt and jampal_out.txt. These are cleared every
            time you start jampal so if be sure to look at them before you
            restart.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Extra large libraries</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Jampal easily handles a library of 40000 songs. If you want to open
            two such libraries at the same time or drag 40000 songs from one to
            another you may run out of memory. If you look in the log file
            mentioned above you would see an out of memory error listed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a library that is too big, or run out of memory for
            some other reason, you can increase the memory allocation for
            jampal. On the command line or in the shortcut, include a parameter
            "-Xmx256M" to allocate 256MB (the default if you do not do this is
            64MB). You can use any value you need on the -Xmx parameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Bad mp3 files</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you find you cannot add an mp3 file to the library or you cannot
            edit the tag, you may have a corrupted tag. To fix this use the
            "Add tracks to library" menu and select the option to remove id3v2
            tags.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand if you get a message "This file is not valid
            MPEG" then it is not an mp3 file. This will happen if you try to
            add a wav file, wma or ogg vorbis. Jampal does not support other
            audio formats. If you try this you may have a long wait before
            seeing the message especially in the case of a wav file. This is
            because jampal is searching the entire file for valid mp3 data
            before displaying the error message. If the file is large this will
            cause some delay.
          </p>

            <i>Please let me know if you find Jampal useful or if you find any
            bugs or shortcomings in it. Also I would like to hear from anybody
            who runs it on linux, macintosh or Solaris. The best way to do this
            is by <a href=
            "http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=370097">posting a
            message</a> at the product information page or else send me email
