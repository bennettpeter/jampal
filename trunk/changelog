  * Load Playlist From File

    Fixed bug where a null pointer exception message displayed when loading
    an m3j playlist.

  * Freetts under Ubuntu
    Support freetts speech generation under Ubuntu if it is installed
    and if jampal is built with the library.

  * Looks under Ubuntu
    Support jgoodies and squareness looks if they are installed 
    via Ubuntu Software Center. (install jgoodies or sqaureness from technical
    option in Ubuntu Software center)

  * Load Playlist From File
    Fixed bug where a null pointer exception message displayed
    when loading an m3j playlist.

  * Help file under Ubuntu
    The help file was not displayed under Ubuntu or any platform that does not
    support the Desktop API. Fixed so that it can use firefox if the desktop
    API is not available.

  * envelope command with playlists
    If the envelope command was used with a playlist generated by the playlist
    command, album names were not printed under certain circumstances.

jampal (02.01.05)

  * ptts

    The ptts.exe utility has been rewritten. It is now a vbs script, run
    with the cscript command. It now supports windows 32 bit as well
    as 64 bit versions and voices.

  * Announcements

    Announcements using the windows speech engine are now fixed to work with
    32 bit and 64 bit JVM, and support 32 bit and 64 bit voices.

jampal (02.01.04)

  * Memory leak

    Fixed memory leak that occurs when closing a library or making certain
    changes with the edit-customize dialog.

  * Man pages

    Added clarification about requirement for lame and Libre Office.

  * Error Handling

    Improved error handling for when components are not installed, and for
    commands run against an empty library.

jampal (02.01.03)

  * Debian support

    Moving debian directory out of the source archive to make sure this is not
    a native debian package.

  * General

    Fixed file permissions on documentation files, removing incorrect execute
    permissions

jampal (02.01.01)

  * Documentation

    Created man pages. Generate html documentation from man pages.
    Automatic generation of html pages from fragments.

  * Debian support

    Consolidated scripts under the jampal command and created man page 
    documentation for them
    Enabled compilation without freetts, since freetts is not available in a
    Debian package.
    Changed build process to use make instead of shell scripts.
    Player can now support a sound system that does not allow master gain control
    Default libraries support columns needed for command line commands.
    Support for help file in a different place in the directory structure,
    using environment properties file.
    Support for relative directories in environment files.
    Default library is now in directory specified in configuration file.
    Improved naming of some menu items.
    Fixed to support the directory structure that is used by mbrola
    under debian.

  * Windows build

    Removed unix scripts from Windows install.
    Added a cygwin install. This includes scripts.
    Included mbrola.exe in windows and cygwin builds, since it is no 
    longer on the mbrola web site.

  * General

    Removed some junk files from source distribution.

jampal (1.26)

 * Tagbkup

   Fixed problem where -f option only works on a unix-formatted file,
   even in Windows.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.25)

 * Copy / Paste
   Fixed problem where paste menu option was not working.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.24)

 * 64 Bit Linux Support

   A 64 bit linux version of tagbkup is now included. Both 32 bit and 64
   bit versions are in the install package so that it can be installed
   on 32 bit or 64 bit Linux systems. The same java versions of the
   jampal program work in 32 bit or 64 bit Linux.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.23)

 * 64 Bit Support

   The install script is updated so that Jampal will support a 32bit or
   64bit version of Java on 64bit Windows systems. If a 64bit Java is
   used, announcements using the Microsoft speech engine currently will
   not work. Other speech options will work.

 * Icons and files

   There is a new icon for Jampal. Also jampal libraries will show the
   icon in Windows explorer, and you can open the library by double
   clicking the library icon.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.22)

 * Track Editor

   The track editor window

    Can now be minimized or maximized. 
    Takes up less space on the screen. 
    Is no longer forced to be in front of the library window. 
    Can be made smaller or bigger without creating a horizontal scroll bar. 
    If images are large, will resize images on the screen to fit without
      a horizontal scroll bar. 
    Supports drag and drop of images from Firefox web browser. 

 * Combine Duplicates

   Short cut menu for combining a track that is on multiple albums into
   one file with "Alternate Albums".

 * Strike-out

   Tracks which are logically deleted by entering a D in the "Jampal"
   field are shown struck out.

 * Look and Feel

   Java looks from various sources are included.

 * Setup

   Setup is upgraded to Inno Setup 5. I have consolidated the windows
   2000 setup, the XP setup and the compact setup into one windows
   setup. The Windows speech engine and Microsoft Mike and Mary voices
   are no longer included. This should not be a problem as versions of
   Windows from XP onwards already include it.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.21)

 * Slow Saving Library

   Saving a large library or closing window with large library over a
   network was slow. (i.e. using a library on a network shared drive).
   This has been fixed.

 * Frames column type

   In the library you can select and display a new column type "FRAMES".
   This includes in the library a list of other frames found in the tag
   (frames not already in the library). For a list of the meanings of
   frames look in the Tables and ID3 Frame Descriptions sections of the
   help. The frames are surrounded by spaces, so that if you want to
   search for tracks with a particular frame, surround the serach field
   by spaces (e.g. use " APIC" to search for tracks with a picture).

 * Improved Status Line

   In the status line at the bottom of the library or playlist it shows
   number of tracks selected, playing time and total file size. In the
   case where files were selected twice, once for their primary album
   and once for alternate album, or because they were in a playlist
   twice, they were being included twice, giving a misleading file size
   total. Now a new value is added ("Files"), which shows the number of
   files with duplicates excluded. The total size is also adjusted to
   exclude duplicates. The number of tracks and playing time still
   includes the duplicates.

 * Preserve Selected Row

   After sorting tracks the selected row will remain selected and be
   scrolled into view.

 * Shuffle

   After shuffle tracks the first row will be scrolled into view and
   selected.

 * Validate Tracks

   The "Validate Tracks" option has been enhanced to refresh track data
   from the disk if it has changed, as well as finding files that have
   been renamed.

 * Find

   Find can search on a specific column without first sorting on the
   column. There is an option to search on the selected column instead
   of the sorted column. When searching on all columns but not for all
   occurrences, it now selects the column in which the string is found.

 * Track Properties

   The Track Properties window now includes a list of frames in the
   track. This displays all frames in the track, unlike the library
   which only displays the id's of frames not already shown in the
   library. For a list of the meanings of frames look in the Tables and
   ID3 Frame Descriptions sections of the help. Also if the Track
   Properties window is open and you change the track selection, the
   track properties window will dynamically update to show the new
   selected track.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.20)

 * Validate Song

   Fixed a bug which was preventing validating songs from the menu or
   when playing.

 * "Follow" Option

   Fixed a bug where song names were announced once at the start of the
   list of connected songs, and again before each song. They should only
   be announced at the start of the sequence of songs, so as to avoid an
   interruption.

 * Null Ponter Exception

   A null pointer exception happened when setting the language to blank
   in the grid.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.19)

 * Deleting of Frames

   Fixed a bug which could cause an exception message when deleting a
   frame that is not supported or that has an error. These frames can
   now be deleted successfully.

 * Tag editor Window

   Changed so that the tag editor window will not move or resize when
   moving from one song to another. This makes it easier to arrange
   windows on the screen when updating many songs.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.18)

 * ESpeak

   Jampal now supports the ESpeak speech engine in Windows, Linux and
   any other environment that supports ESpeak. It also supports mbrola
   voices when used with espeak.

 * Multi Language Announcements 

   You can now announce your song titles in the language that matches
   the song name. There is a new Voices tab in the configuration dialog
   that allows you to select voices to be used with each song language.
   You can select for each language which engine and voice will be used.

 * Multi Language Songs

   You can now assign more than one language to a song. This will be
   useful if the language for the announcement should be different from
   the main laguange for the song. Announcements use the last language
   in the list.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.17)

 * Unicode

   Jampal now supports full use of unicode character sets. There is a
   font menu option so that if you are using non-English characters you
   can select an appropriate font to display them.

   This also fixes a problem where if an ID3V2.4 tag with UTF-8 font was
   edited, an incorrect ID3V2.3 tag was created that caused Microsoft
   media player to refuse to play the file.

 * Help Menu

   Added a Help menu item to display the online help pages.

 * Compiler Upgrades

   Jampal now requires Java version 6.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.16)

 * Most Recently Used list

   Open menu includes a list of the libraries opened recently to save
   time when opening libraries.

 * Alternate Album

   Custom tag for the case where one song is on two or more albums. You
   can record additional albums in a comments tag. The additional
   entries will be added to the library so that when sorting by album
   you can see the song in both albums although only one copy of the
   song exists on your hard drive.

 * Duplicate entries in playlist

   You can now have multiple copies of a track in a playlist. This is
   regardless of the alternate album setting. If you want to play the
   same song 100 times, just add it to the playlist 100 times.

 * Library save Improvement

   When saving a library using the File, Save Library option, save
   settings such as last song playing, selection, window size.

 * Compiler Upgrades

   Jampal now requires Java version 5.
   ptts is now compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (V8).
   tagbkup for windows is now compiled with g++ (GCC) 3.4.5
   tagbkup for cygwin is now compiled with gcc g++ (GCC) 3.3.3
   tagbkup for linux is compiled with g++ (GCC) 4.1.3

 * Sound Quality

   In some environments, sound quality was degraded. To avoid this an
   extra customization parameter has been added for mixer name. In most
   cases selecting the mixer "Java Sound Audio Engine" will provide best
   quality, but you can now try different options in case the sound does
   not work or is poor quality.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.14)

 * Validate Tracks

   After a "Validate Tracks" operation, tracks which could not be
   validated or repaired remain selected.

 * Enhanced Status line

   The status line at the bottom of the window shows the number of songs
   that have been selected. It is now enhanced to also show the total
   playing time in days, hours, minutes, seconds, as well as the total
   file size in megabytes. These only work if the playing time and file
   size are selected in the library fields in the customization dialog.

 * Missing files in source zip

   Some files that were needed to build the program were missing from
   the source zip. These have been added.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.13)

 * Java versions 5 and 6

   Minor changes (see below) have been made to ensure the program runs
   well with the latest versions of Java.

 * Cell Selection Display

   With the Java version 5 and 6 default table behaviour, it is very
   difficult to see which is the current selected cell. A very thin gray
   border is painted on a blue background. To make it possible to see
   the currently selected cell, Jampal now paints the selected cell in
   "unselected" colors. This makes it easier to see where you are before
   using "Edit Cell".

 * Automatic Cell Editing

   Added the "Automatic Cell Editing" checkbox and menu item.

 * Bug with sorting and moving columns

   If you moved some columns to new positions then sorted on columns, in
   some cases the sort indicator was not removed when the sort no longer
   applied.

 * Sound Distortion

   Java versions 5 and 6 use a different default volume setting. The
   sound from Jampal would be distorted unless you adjusted the "audio
   gain" in the customization page. With this version the audio gain
   will default to 0 if you are running java 5 or 6.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.12)

 * Announcements

   Enhanced the announcements feature so that any information from the
   tag can be used in the announcement.

 * Validate Tracks

   New "Validate Tracks" menu which scans selected tracks in a library
   or playlist, fixes invalid filenames where possible and reports back
   which ones could not be found. Previously this validation only
   occurred when playing a song.

 * Fix Case

   "Fix Case" option did not work correctly where a word started with a
   special character, for example parenthesis or quote.

 * Album Sort

   Album sort did not work where you had a disk number in parentheses ,
   for example (Disk 1) (Disk 2) for the same album, disks 1 and 2 were
   intermingled. Now fixed.

 * Follow option

   Some bugs were fixed in the operation of the "follow" logic.

 * Track Number

   If you used a three digit track number (i.e. greater than 99) the
   sort by track would not work correctly. Now fixed.

 * mp3 Management Scripts

   Added more documentation. Also some bug fixes and minor enhancements.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.11)

 * mp3 Management

   A suite of shell scripts to organize your mp3 files, create
   playlists, create CDs, find duplicates, manage backups. Currently
   beta test and requires some understanding of shell scripts.

   Rename your files into directories per album and name the files with 
     song titles and artists. 
   Create a printed envelope for CDs with a printed track listing insert. 
   Detect duplicate songs and with an easy interface decide which ones 
     to remove and which ones to keep. 
   Create playlists based on any number of parameters you specify. 
     Arrange these playlists into mp3 CDs, mp3 DVDs, or write them 
     directly to an mp3 player. Optionally include song announcements on 
     your mp3 CDs or mp3 player. 
   Encode mp3 files with lame, or re-encode to a new bitrate keeping 
     tags intact. 
   Backup your tags with a script. 
   Compare what is on your hard drive with what is on CD/DVD to make 
     sure everything is backed up on CD/DVD. 
   If you lose your hard drive, you can restore your files from CD, at 
     the same time restoring tag updates that were done after the files 
     were put to CD. 
   ptts command line speech script that works with any of 3 speech 
     engines. 

 * Unicode

   Fixed bug which caused unicode encoded tags to display incorrectly

 * Linux support

   Now supports dropping files from the Nautilus file manager on to
   Jampal. Also dropping pictures from the Nautilus file manager or
   Epiphany web browser on to the tag editor. Dropping files from Jampal
   on to the Nautilus file manager does not work.

 * Drag and drop, copy

   If you drag files from jampal to a text editor you can get a list of
   file names. You can also drag a list of file names from a text editor
   to jampal and those files will be added to the library.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.10)

 * Linux Support

   Improved Linux support includes a version of tagbkup compiled for
   Linux and a zip install with shell script to install on Linux. Also
   support for speech on Linux.

 * New Speech Engines

   The Announcement feature adds support for two new speech engines:
   FreeTTS and Cepstral, so that speech can be used on non-Microsoft
   systems, and better quality speech can be used on all systems. Also
   adds extra voice related customizations.

 * Other

   TagUpdate has a new "SHORTDISPLAY" option.

   If you launch a new instance of Jampal it will bring to the front the
   existing instance. This ensures that libraries are kept in sync.

   When using Unix Path option, prevent adding files to the library from
   the wrong drive letter. (Previously this would work but the files
   could not be played).

   When using Unix Path option, allow files with UNC paths to be added.

   Added Splash screen when opening a library. 

   Fixed bug where adding a Language frame caused screen corruption. 

   When Pasting a large number of tracks, if one fails it will still
   paste the rest.

   There are some new options for the ptts text to speech program

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.09)

 * New Customize Feature

   New Customize feature allows the user to customize the library and
   many options. These are customized with a Graphical interface where
   previously they could only be customized by editing a file. Also some
   new options have been added.

 * New Command Line Tag Update Program

   A new program, TagUpdate, is for users who wish to update tags from a
   command line program. It offers all of the updating features
   available in the Graphical Program.

 * New look and feel option

   A new option in the Customize dialog allows you to select your look
   and feel. To accomodate different looks, the last-playing track is
   now highlighted in bold instead of in red.

 * New resize option

   A new option in the Customize dialog allows you to select how your
   table will be treated when resizing the window or the columns.

 * Tagbkup -x option

   Added a new option (-x) to cater for file system limitations of 16384
   files per directory.

 * Unix / Linux settings

   Added a new library option on the customize page to enable easier
   sharing of files between unix/linux and windows.

 * Slider Operation

   Fixed the bug where adjusting the slider during play sometimes caused
   the play position to jump.

 * Saved Settings

   The file library_saved.properties is no longer used. Settings are
   save in library.jampal instead.

 * Status Line

   Changed the status line to show the row number selected when only 1
   row is selected.

 * Tag Editor Resize

   If you make the tag editor window wider, the space for entering
   values will increase.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.08)

 * Interruption in play

   Made a change to reduce the chance of a brief gap between two songs
   being played continuously in a playlist. This affects albums where
   songs run into each other in continuous fashion.

 * Slider Operation

   Fixed problem where occasionally operating the slider to move to
   another place in the song would stop the play of that song.

 * SUN Java mp3 Plugin

   Changed so that if you have the SUN Java MP3 plugin installed, jampal
   will play using that plugin instead of the "tritonus" mp3 decoder
   included in jampal. The SUN Java MP3 plugin can be downloaded and
   installed for free. Jampal writes a trace message in the
   .jampal/jampal_err.txt file in your home directory to indicate which
   plugin is being used.

 * Fix Case

   You can now use the super tagging feature to correct song titles or
   other values which were typed in UPPER CASE or lower case without
   retyping the names. Also a new "Fix Case" checkbox added to tag
   update page.

 * Find

   Many new and advanced features added to the Find Dialog.

 * Sort

   Fixed so sort field takes into account spaces.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.07)

 * Fixed bug loading m3u files

   m3u playlist files could not be loaded with version 1.06.

 * Variable bit rate problem

   If you had a file with variable bit rate and no xing header, the
   bitrate and playing time were incorrect.

 * Playlist with duplicate songs

   If you loaded a playlist from an m3u or m3j file and there were
   duplicate songs you could get a java error message (Row index out of
   range), although the playlist was loaded successfully.

 * Playlist directory

   When you load a playlist from a file, the program will start from the
   directory you last used for loading a playlist.

 * Missing files

   If a file in a playlist is missing the program will display a message
   and continue with the next one, up to 5 files. This was not working
   due to a shortcoming in the "Follow" enhancement from the previous
   version.

 * Track Properties Display

   There is a new menu option from the Edit menu and the library context
   menu. This displays technical data about the mp3 file.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.06)

 * Find bug fixed

   If you used "Find" with the option of searching the sort columns and
   you typed two words, the search failed.

 * Follow

   A new feature of Jampal allows you to specify that multiple tracks
   must be played together. See the Follow option.

 * Play bug fixed

   If you selected another song for play while the announcement was
   still playing, an error message was displayed after 30 seconds. (The
   Song that is Playing will not end).

 * Search for renamed files

   If a file has been renamed in the library, but the playlist has the
   old name or any wrong name, it searches the library and it it finds
   the song it will play it and update the play list.

 * Improved continuous option

   With the continuous option, the song could be overlapped with the
   previous song. This will no longer happen.

 * Read-only library or playlist

   If the "jmp" file is read-only, you can play the songs and reorder
   the library. Any attempt to update a tag or the library will give an
   error message that the library is read-only.

 * Dummy Columns in the Library or playlist

   You can add "dummy" columns to a library or playlist. You can type
   anything you like into these and they will be stored in the library
   but not on the mp3 song tag.

 * Fixed Header Resize Cursor Bug

   If you clicked the table header in the library or playlist while the
   resize cursor is displayed, It would sort the library and after that
   the resize cursor vanished until you shut down the program.

 * Search Enhancements

   When searching the search string is now displayed in the status bar
   at the bottom of the window. Also the search now supports the
   backspace key.

 * Cell Edit Enhancement

   When editing a field in the summary list the value will be initially
   selected so that you can easily overtype it with a complete new
   value.

   Fixed the bug where a cell that was being edited was displayed as
   blank if you press escape to cancel the editing.

 * Playback Volume

   Java sound by default reduces the volume level of sounds. Added an
   entry to the library parameter file to supply a gain value to
   counteract this.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.05)

 * Playing Song Flagged

   The song that is currently playing or last played is shown in red in
   the library or playlist. A new menu option clears the highlight.

 * Play options

   If no song is selected when starting play, either the one shown in
   red is played or if there is none shown in red, play starts at the
   top.

 * Add to Playlist option

   When adding to playlist, the new songs are selected, also the one
   shown in red, so you can continue playing from the same place more
   easily.

 * Shuffle, sort and play

   If shuffle or sort is done while playing, the next song played
   becomes the new one that follows the current song in the playlist.

 * File read errors

   If a file read error occurs during playback (the most common error is
   "file not found" because the file has been removed or renamed),
   playback does not stop. In the playlist it continues to play the next
   song, but stops after five such errors occur.

 * Play Menu

   Added a play menu with keyboard shortcuts for play commands.

 * Pause / Stop

   Fixed bug where pressing stop after pause did not reset slider and
   song position.

 * Default button

   Set the "Update Tags" button as default on tag editor window, so
   pressing enter can update the tags.

 * Tag Updater Window

   Changed so that it uses the screen size as the maximum window size.
   No longer using the "dialog-max-height" property. Also changed to
   move the window onscreen if it becomes larger and starts to overlap
   the edge of the screen.

 * Default Track title

   If a file has no tag or the track title is empty, the file name
   (without the mp3 extension) will be displayed as the track title.
   Also if any field is updated on the tag and the tag title is missing,
   the file name will be put there. The file name is edited according to
   the same rules as for super tagging.

 * Super Tagging underscore

   Added underscore as a character substituted during super tagging.

 * Windows shut down or logoff

   Closes jampal if you log off or shut down Windows.

 * Continuous Option

   A new "Continuous" option in the "Play" menu to avoid a gap between
   one track and the next. It also overlaps announcements with the
   music.

 * m3j type playlist

   A new type of saved playlist file, the m3j file saves just the song
   title and artist name, and searches the library for the matching file
   at the time of playing. So if files are renamed or moved the playlist
   still works. The search excludes special characters and parenthesized
   parts to make it easier to find a match.

 * Changes to Search

   When searching for a song by typing the sort key value, special
   characters and parenthesized parts are excluded.

 * Blank Window

   Fixed bug where a blank window could be left on screen if you tried
   to open a library then canceled the operation.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.04)

 * Additional Frames

   Displays the "Private" frame and any Unicode text that may be
   associated with it. If the frame is 4 bytes long displays an integer
   value assuming the integer is stored in Microsoft format. This frame
   cannot be updated.

   These changes allow you to see the values put there by the windows
   media player. Note that Microsoft is using the private frame
   incorrectly, the description is supposed to be a URL or email
   address, and text ought to be stored in a comments frame or user
   defined text frame, not the user defined binary frame.

 * "Delete Frame" Bug fixed

   Frames that cannot be edited should be able to be deleted. This was
   causing a Class Cast Exception error message.

 * Internet Explorer Problem Fix

   When viewing the documentation, Internet Explorer in Windows XP after
   security patches displays a warning about Active Content. Changed the
   shortcut to avoid this.

 * Tag Backup multiple id3v1 tags

   When copying the id3v1 tag to an mp3 file that already has more than
   1 id3v1 tag, removes the extra tags before copying.

 * Tag Backup copy music

   Fixed bug where the -cm (copy music) option copied the id3v1tag also.

 * Jampal and multiple id3v1 tags

   If a file has more than one id3v1 tag, when updating the tag, excess
   tags will be removed so that only 1 id3v1 tag remains.

 -- Peter Bennett <pgbennett@users.sourceforge.net>

jampal (1.03)

 * New Find option

   A new option on the edit menu, "Find" searches the library for a
   string. Unlike the existing search, it is not limited to the
