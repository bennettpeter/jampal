    This is a list of the new features and changes in Jampal 
    <p>
      <b>Version 02.01.05</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>ptts</i><br>
       The ptts.exe utility has been rewritten. It is now a vbs
      script, run with the cscript command. It now supports
      windows 32 bit as well as 64 bit versions and voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Announcements</i><br>
       Announcements using the windows speech engine are now fixed to
      work with 32 bit and 64 bit JVM, and support 32 bit and
      64 bit voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 02.01.04</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Memory leak</i><br>
       Fixed memory leak that occurs when closing a library or
      making certain changes with the edit-customize dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Man pages</i><br>
       Added clarification about requirement for lame and Libre
      Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Error Handling</i><br>
       Improved error handling for when components are not
      installed, and for commands run against an empty library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 02.01.01</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Packaged for Debian / Ubuntu</i><br>
       Debian source and install packages, ready for inclusion in
      the Debian or Ubuntu repository, or download from
      sourceforge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Documentation</i><br>
       Created man pages. Generate html documentation from man
      pages. Automatic generation of html pages from fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Debian support</i><br>
       Consolidated scripts under the jampal command and created
      man page documentation for them<br>
       Enabled compilation without freetts, since freetts is not
      available in a Debian package.<br>
       Changed build process to use make instead of shell
      scripts.<br>
       Player can now support a sound system that does not allow
      master gain control.<br>
       Default libraries support columns needed for command line
      commands.<br>
       Support for help file in a different place in the
      directory structure, using environment properties file.<br>
       Support for relative directories in environment files.<br>
       Default library is now in directory specified in
      configuration file.<br>
       Improved naming of some menu items.<br>
       Fixed to support the directory structure that is used by
      mbrola under debian.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Windows build</i><br>
       Removed unix scripts from Windows install.<br>
       Added a cygwin install. This includes scripts.<br>
       Included mbrola.exe in windows and cygwin builds, since it
      is no longer on the mbrola web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>General</i><br>
       Removed some junk files from source distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.26</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tagbkup</i><br>
       Fixed problem where -f option only works on a
      unix-formatted file, even in Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.25</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Copy / Paste</i><br>
       Fixed problem where paste menu option was not working.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.24</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>64 Bit Linux Support</i><br>
       A 64 bit linux version of tagbkup is now included. Both 32
      bit and 64 bit versions are in the install package so that
      it can be installed on 32 bit or 64 bit Linux systems. The
      same java versions of the jampal program work in 32 bit or
      64 bit Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.23</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>64 Bit Support</i><br>
       The install script is updated so that Jampal will support
      a 32bit or 64bit version of Java on 64bit Windows systems.
      If a 64bit Java is used, announcements using the Microsoft
      speech engine currently will not work. Other speech options
      will work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Icons and files</i><br>
       There is a new icon for Jampal. Also jampal libraries will
      show the icon in Windows explorer, and you can open the
      library by double clicking the library icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.22</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Track Editor</i><br>
       The track editor window
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can now be minimized or maximized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Takes up less space on the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Is no longer forced to be in front of the library window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be made smaller or bigger without creating a
        horizontal scroll bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        If images are large, will resize images on the screen to
        fit without a horizontal scroll bar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports drag and drop of images from Firefox web
        browser.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i>Combine Duplicates</i><br>
       Short cut menu for combining a track that is on multiple
      albums into one file with "Alternate Albums".
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Strike-out</i><br>
       Tracks which are logically deleted by entering a D in the
      "Jampal" field are shown struck out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Look and Feel</i><br>
       Java looks from various sources are included.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Setup</i><br>
       Setup is upgraded to Inno Setup 5. I have consolidated the
      windows 2000 setup, the XP setup and the compact setup into
      one windows setup. The Windows speech engine and Microsoft
      Mike and Mary voices are no longer included. This should
      not be a problem as versions of Windows from XP onwards
      already include it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.21</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Slow Saving Library</i><br>
       Saving a large library or closing window with large
      library over a network was slow. (i.e. using a library on a
      network shared drive). This has been fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Frames column type</i><br>
       In the library you can select and display a new column
      type "FRAMES". This includes in the library a list of other
      frames found in the tag (frames not already in the
      library). For a list of the meanings of frames look in the
      <a href="tables.html">Tables</a> and <a href=
      "frames.html">ID3 Frame Descriptions</a> sections of the
      help. The frames are surrounded by spaces, so that if you
      want to search for tracks with a particular frame, surround
      the serach field by spaces (e.g. use " APIC" to search for
      tracks with a picture).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Improved Status Line</i><br>
       In the status line at the bottom of the library or
      playlist it shows number of tracks selected, playing time
      and total file size. In the case where files were selected
      twice, once for their primary album and once for alternate
      album, or because they were in a playlist twice, they were
      being included twice, giving a misleading file size total.
      Now a new value is added ("Files"), which shows the number
      of files with duplicates excluded. The total size is also
      adjusted to exclude duplicates. The number of tracks and
      playing time still includes the duplicates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Preserve Selected Row</i><br>
       After sorting tracks the selected row will remain selected
      and be scrolled into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Shuffle</i><br>
       After shuffle tracks the first row will be scrolled into
      view and selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Validate Tracks</i><br>
       The "Validate Tracks" option has been enhanced to refresh
      track data from the disk if it has changed, as well as
      finding files that have been renamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Find</i><br>
       Find can search on a specific column without first sorting
      on the column. There is an option to search on the selected
      column instead of the sorted column. When searching on all
      columns but not for all occurrences, it now selects the
      column in which the string is found.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Track Properties</i><br>
       The Track Properties window now includes a list of frames
      in the track. This displays all frames in the track, unlike
      the library which only displays the id's of frames not
      already shown in the library. For a list of the meanings of
      frames look in the <a href="tables.html">Tables</a> and <a
      href="frames.html">ID3 Frame Descriptions</a> sections of
      the help. Also if the Track Properties window is open and
      you change the track selection, the track properties window
      will dynamically update to show the new selected track.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.20</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Validate Song</i><br>
       Fixed a bug which was preventing validating songs from the
      menu or when playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Follow" Option</i><br>
       Fixed a bug where song names were announced once at the
      start of the list of connected songs, and again before each
      song. They should only be announced at the start of the
      sequence of songs, so as to avoid an interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Null Ponter Exception</i><br>
       A null pointer exception happened when setting the
      language to blank in the grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.19</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Deleting of Frames</i><br>
       Fixed a bug which could cause an exception message when
      deleting a frame that is not supported or that has an
      error. These frames can now be deleted successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tag editor Window</i><br>
       Changed so that the tag editor window will not move or
      resize when moving from one song to another. This makes it
      easier to arrange windows on the screen when updating many
      songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.18</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>ESpeak</i><br>
       Jampal now supports the ESpeak speech engine in Windows,
      Linux and any other environment that supports ESpeak. It
      also supports mbrola voices when used with espeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Multi Language Announcements</i><br>
       You can now announce your song titles in the language that
      matches the song name. There is a new Voices tab in the
      configuration dialog that allows you to select voices to be
      used with each song language. You can select for each
      language which engine and voice will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Multi Language Songs</i><br>
       You can now assign more than one language to a song. This
      will be useful if the language for the announcement should
      be different from the main laguange for the song.
      Announcements use the last language in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.17</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Unicode</i><br>
       Jampal now supports full use of unicode character sets.
      There is a font menu option so that if you are using
      non-English characters you can select an appropriate font
      to display them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also fixes a problem where if an ID3V2.4 tag with
      UTF-8 font was edited, an incorrect ID3V2.3 tag was created
      that caused Microsoft media player to refuse to play the
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Help Menu</i><br>
       Added a Help menu item to display the online help pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Compiler Upgrades</i><br>
       Jampal now requires Java version 6.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.16</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Most Recently Used list</i><br>
       Open menu includes a list of the libraries opened recently
      to save time when opening libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Alternate Album</i><br>
       Custom tag for the case where one song is on two or more
      albums. You can record additional albums in a comments tag.
      The additional entries will be added to the library so that
      when sorting by album you can see the song in both albums
      although only one copy of the song exists on your hard
      drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Duplicate entries in playlist</i><br>
       You can now have multiple copies of a track in a playlist.
      This is regardless of the alternate album setting. If you
      want to play the same song 100 times, just add it to the
      playlist 100 times.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Library save Improvement</i><br>
       When saving a library using the File, Save Library option,
      save settings such as last song playing, selection, window
      size.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Compiler Upgrades</i><br>
       Jampal now requires Java version 5.<br>
       ptts is now compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005
      (V8).<br>
       tagbkup for windows is now compiled with g++ (GCC)
      3.4.5<br>
       tagbkup for cygwin is now compiled with gcc g++ (GCC)
      3.3.3<br>
       tagbkup for linux is compiled with g++ (GCC) 4.1.3<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sound Quality</i><br>
       In some environments, sound quality was degraded. To avoid
      this an extra customization parameter has been added for
      mixer name. In most cases selecting the mixer "Java Sound
      Audio Engine" will provide best quality, but you can now
      try different options in case the sound does not work or is
      poor quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.14</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Validate Tracks</i><br>
       After a "Validate Tracks" operation, tracks which could
      not be validated or repaired remain selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enhanced Status line</i><br>
       The status line at the bottom of the window shows the
      number of songs that have been selected. It is now enhanced
      to also show the total playing time in days, hours,
      minutes, seconds, as well as the total file size in
      megabytes. These only work if the playing time and file
      size are selected in the library fields in the
      customization dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Missing files in source zip</i><br>
       Some files that were needed to build the program were
      missing from the source zip. These have been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.13</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Java versions 5 and 6</i><br>
       Minor changes (see below) have been made to ensure the
      program runs well with the latest versions of Java.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cell Selection Display</i><br>
       With the Java version 5 and 6 default table behaviour, it
      is very difficult to see which is the current selected
      cell. A very thin gray border is painted on a blue
      background. To make it possible to see the currently
      selected cell, Jampal now paints the selected cell in
      "unselected" colors. This makes it easier to see where you
      are before using "Edit Cell".
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Automatic Cell Editing</i><br>
       Added the "Automatic Cell Editing" checkbox and menu item.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bug with sorting and moving columns</i><br>
       If you moved some columns to new positions then sorted on
      columns, in some cases the sort indicator was not removed
      when the sort no longer applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sound Distortion</i><br>
       Java versions 5 and 6 use a different default volume
      setting. The sound from Jampal would be distorted unless
      you adjusted the "audio gain" in the customization page.
      With this version the audio gain will default to 0 if you
      are running java 5 or 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.12</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Announcements</i><br>
       Enhanced the announcements feature so that any information
      from the tag can be used in the announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Validate Tracks</i><br>
       New "Validate Tracks" menu which scans selected tracks in
      a library or playlist, fixes invalid filenames where
      possible and reports back which ones could not be found.
      Previously this validation only occurred when playing a
      song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fix Case</i><br>
       "Fix Case" option did not work correctly where a word
      started with a special character, for example parenthesis
      or quote.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Album Sort</i><br>
       Album sort did not work where you had a disk number in
      parentheses , for example (Disk 1) (Disk 2) for the same
      album, disks 1 and 2 were intermingled. Now fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Follow option</i><br>
       Some bugs were fixed in the operation of the "follow"
      logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Track Number</i><br>
       If you used a three digit track number (i.e. greater than
      99) the sort by track would not work correctly. Now fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>mp3 Management Scripts</i><br>
       Added more documentation. Also some bug fixes and minor
      enhancements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.11</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><a href="scripts.html">mp3 Management</a></i><br>
       A suite of shell scripts to organize your mp3 files,
      create playlists, create CDs, find duplicates, manage
      backups. Currently beta test and requires some
      understanding of shell scripts.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rename your files into directories per album and name the
        files with song titles and artists.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a printed envelope for CDs with a printed track
        listing insert.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detect duplicate songs and with an easy interface decide
        which ones to remove and which ones to keep.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create playlists based on any number of parameters you
        specify. Arrange these playlists into mp3 CDs, mp3 DVDs,
        or write them directly to an mp3 player. Optionally
        include song announcements on your mp3 CDs or mp3 player.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encode mp3 files with lame, or re-encode to a new bitrate
        keeping tags intact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Backup your tags with a script.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare what is on your hard drive with what is on CD/DVD
        to make sure everything is backed up on CD/DVD.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you lose your hard drive, you can restore your files
        from CD, at the same time restoring tag updates that were
        done after the files were put to CD.
      </li>
      <li>
        ptts command line speech script that works with any of 3
        speech engines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i>Unicode</i><br>
       Fixed bug which caused unicode encoded tags to display
      incorrectly
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Linux support</i><br>
       Now supports dropping files from the Nautilus file manager
      on to Jampal. Also dropping pictures from the Nautilus file
      manager or Epiphany web browser on to the tag editor.
      Dropping files from Jampal on to the Nautilus file manager
      does not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Drag and drop, copy</i><br>
       If you drag files from jampal to a text editor you can get
      a list of file names. You can also drag a list of file
      names from a text editor to jampal and those files will be
      added to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.10</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Linux Support</i><br>
       Improved Linux support includes a version of tagbkup
      compiled for Linux and a zip install with shell script to
      install on Linux. Also support for speech on Linux.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>New Speech Engines</i><br>
       The Announcement feature adds support for two new speech
      engines: FreeTTS and Cepstral, so that speech can be used
      on non-Microsoft systems, and better quality speech can be
      used on all systems. Also adds extra voice related
      customizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Other</i><br>
       TagUpdate has a new "SHORTDISPLAY" option.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you launch a new instance of Jampal it will bring to the
      front the existing instance. This ensures that libraries
      are kept in sync.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using Unix Path option, prevent adding files to the
      library from the wrong drive letter. (Previously this would
      work but the files could not be played).
    </p>
    <p>
      When using Unix Path option, allow files with UNC paths to
      be added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Added Splash screen when opening a library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed bug where adding a Language frame caused screen
      corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pasting a large number of tracks, if one fails it will
      still paste the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some new options for the ptts text to speech
      program
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.09</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>New Customize Feature</i><br>
       New Customize feature allows the user to customize the
      library and many options. These are customized with a
      Graphical interface where previously they could only be
      customized by editing a file. Also some new options have
      been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>New Command Line Tag Update Program</i><br>
       A new program, TagUpdate, is for users who wish to update
      tags from a command line program. It offers all of the
      updating features available in the Graphical Program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>New look and feel option</i><br>
       A new option in the Customize dialog allows you to select
      your look and feel. To accomodate different looks, the
      last-playing track is now highlighted in bold instead of in
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>New resize option</i><br>
       A new option in the Customize dialog allows you to select
      how your table will be treated when resizing the window or
      the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tagbkup -x option</i><br>
       Added a new option (-x) to cater for file system
      limitations of 16384 files per directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Unix / Linux settings</i><br>
       Added a new library option on the customize page to enable
      easier sharing of files between unix/linux and windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Slider Operation</i><br>
       Fixed the bug where adjusting the slider during play
      sometimes caused the play position to jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Saved Settings</i><br>
       The file library_saved.properties is no longer used.
      Settings are save in library.jampal instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Status Line</i><br>
       Changed the status line to show the row number selected
      when only 1 row is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tag Editor Resize</i><br>
       If you make the tag editor window wider, the space for
      entering values will increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.08</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Interruption in play</i><br>
       Made a change to reduce the chance of a brief gap between
      two songs being played continuously in a playlist. This
      affects albums where songs run into each other in
      continuous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Slider Operation</i><br>
       Fixed problem where occasionally operating the slider to
      move to another place in the song would stop the play of
      that song.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>SUN Java mp3 Plugin</i><br>
       Changed so that if you have the <a href=
      "http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/mp3/download.html">
      SUN Java MP3 plugin</a> installed, jampal will play using
      that plugin instead of the "tritonus" mp3 decoder included
      in jampal. The <a href=
      "http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/mp3/download.html">
      SUN Java MP3 plugin</a> can be downloaded and installed for
      free. Jampal writes a trace message in the
      .jampal/jampal_err.txt file in your home directory to
      indicate which plugin is being used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fix Case</i><br>
       You can now use the super tagging feature to correct song
      titles or other values which were typed in UPPER CASE or
      lower case without retyping the names. Also a new "Fix
      Case" checkbox added to tag update page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Find</i><br>
       Many new and advanced features added to the Find Dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sort</i><br>
       Fixed so sort field takes into account spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.07</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fixed bug loading m3u files</i><br>
       m3u playlist files could not be loaded with version 1.06.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Variable bit rate problem</i><br>
       If you had a file with variable bit rate and no xing
      header, the bitrate and playing time were incorrect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Playlist with duplicate songs</i><br>
       If you loaded a playlist from an m3u or m3j file and there
      were duplicate songs you could get a java error message
      (Row index out of range), although the playlist was loaded
      successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Playlist directory</i><br>
       When you load a playlist from a file, the program will
      start from the directory you last used for loading a
      playlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Missing files</i><br>
       If a file in a playlist is missing the program will
      display a message and continue with the next one, up to 5
      files. This was not working due to a shortcoming in the <a
      href="playlist.html#follow">"Follow"</a> enhancement from
      the previous version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Track Properties Display</i><br>
       There is a new menu option from the Edit menu and the
      library context menu. This displays technical data about
      the mp3 file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.06</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Find bug fixed</i><br>
       If you used "Find" with the option of searching the sort
      columns and you typed two words, the search failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Follow</i><br>
       A new feature of Jampal allows you to specify that
      multiple tracks must be played together. See the <a href=
      "playlist.html#follow">Follow</a> option.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Play bug fixed</i><br>
       If you selected another song for play while the
      announcement was still playing, an error message was
      displayed after 30 seconds. (The Song that is Playing will
      not end).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Search for renamed files</i><br>
       If a file has been renamed in the library, but the
      playlist has the old name or any wrong name, it searches
      the library and it it finds the song it will play it and
      update the play list.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Improved continuous option</i><br>
       With the continuous option, the song could be overlapped
      with the previous song. This will no longer happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Read-only library or playlist</i><br>
       If the "jmp" file is read-only, you can play the songs and
      reorder the library. Any attempt to update a tag or the
      library will give an error message that the library is
      read-only.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dummy Columns in the Library or playlist</i><br>
       You can add "dummy" columns to a library or playlist. You
      can type anything you like into these and they will be
      stored in the library but not on the mp3 song tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fixed Header Resize Cursor Bug</i><br>
       If you clicked the table header in the library or playlist
      while the resize cursor is displayed, It would sort the
      library and after that the resize cursor vanished until you
      shut down the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Search Enhancements</i><br>
       When searching the search string is now displayed in the
      status bar at the bottom of the window. Also the search now
      supports the backspace key.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cell Edit Enhancement</i><br>
       When editing a field in the summary list the value will be
      initially selected so that you can easily overtype it with
      a complete new value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixed the bug where a cell that was being edited was
      displayed as blank if you press escape to cancel the
      editing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Playback Volume</i><br>
       Java sound by default reduces the volume level of sounds.
      Added an entry to the library parameter file to supply a
      gain value to counteract this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.05</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Playing Song Flagged</i><br>
       The song that is currently playing or last played is shown
      in red in the library or playlist. A new menu option clears
      the highlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Play options</i><br>
       If no song is selected when starting play, either the one
      shown in red is played or if there is none shown in red,
      play starts at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Add to Playlist option</i><br>
       When adding to playlist, the new songs are selected, also
      the one shown in red, so you can continue playing from the
      same place more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Shuffle, sort and play</i><br>
       If shuffle or sort is done while playing, the next song
      played becomes the new one that follows the current song in
      the playlist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>File read errors</i><br>
       If a file read error occurs during playback (the most
      common error is "file not found" because the file has been
      removed or renamed), playback does not stop. In the
      playlist it continues to play the next song, but stops
      after five such errors occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Play Menu</i><br>
       Added a play menu with keyboard shortcuts for play
      commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pause / Stop</i><br>
       Fixed bug where pressing stop after pause did not reset
      slider and song position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Default button</i><br>
       Set the "Update Tags" button as default on tag editor
      window, so pressing enter can update the tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tag Updater Window</i><br>
       Changed so that it uses the screen size as the maximum
      window size. No longer using the "dialog-max-height"
      property. Also changed to move the window onscreen if it
      becomes larger and starts to overlap the edge of the
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Default Track title</i><br>
       If a file has no tag or the track title is empty, the file
      name (without the mp3 extension) will be displayed as the
      track title. Also if any field is updated on the tag and
      the tag title is missing, the file name will be put there.
      The file name is edited according to the same rules as for
      <a href="editor.html">super tagging</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Super Tagging underscore</i><br>
       Added underscore as a character substituted during super
      tagging.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Windows shut down or logoff</i><br>
       Closes jampal if you log off or shut down Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Continuous Option</i><br>
       A new "Continuous" option in the "Play" menu to avoid a
      gap between one track and the next. It also overlaps
      announcements with the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>m3j type playlist</i><br>
       A new type of saved playlist file, the m3j file saves just
      the song title and artist name, and searches the library
      for the matching file at the time of playing. So if files
      are renamed or moved the playlist still works. The search
      excludes special characters and parenthesized parts to make
      it easier to find a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Changes to Search</i><br>
       When searching for a song by typing the sort key value,
      special characters and parenthesized parts are excluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Blank Window</i><br>
       Fixed bug where a blank window could be left on screen if
      you tried to open a library then canceled the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.04</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Additional Frames</i><br>
       Displays the "Private" frame and any Unicode text that may
      be associated with it. If the frame is 4 bytes long
      displays an integer value assuming the integer is stored in
      Microsoft format. This frame cannot be updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      These changes allow you to see the values put there by the
      windows media player. Note that Microsoft is using the
      private frame incorrectly, the description is supposed to
      be a URL or email address, and text ought to be stored in a
      comments frame or user defined text frame, not the user
      defined binary frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Delete Frame" Bug fixed</i><br>
       Frames that cannot be edited should be able to be deleted.
      This was causing a Class Cast Exception error message.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Internet Explorer Problem Fix</i><br>
       When viewing the documentation, Internet Explorer in
      Windows XP after security patches displays a warning about
      Active Content. Changed the shortcut to avoid this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tag Backup multiple id3v1 tags</i><br>
       When copying the id3v1 tag to an mp3 file that already has
      more than 1 id3v1 tag, removes the extra tags before
      copying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tag Backup copy music</i><br>
       Fixed bug where the -cm (copy music) option copied the
      id3v1tag also.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jampal and multiple id3v1 tags</i><br>
       If a file has more than one id3v1 tag, when updating the
      tag, excess tags will be removed so that only 1 id3v1 tag
      remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Version 1.03</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>New Find option</i><br>
       A new option on the edit menu, "Find" searches the library
      for a string. Unlike the existing search, it is not limited
      to the beginning of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ignore diacritics</i><br>
       When sorting or searching diacritics in the library are
      ignored. Diacritics are the marks on letters mainly used in
      foreign languages and heavy metal band names, for example
      Motley Crue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Text to Speech - Update Lexicon</i><br>
       When the speech engine mispronounces a name, the ptts
      program now gives you the ability to update the lexicon to
      correct it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Language Tag</i><br>
       Improved support for the language tag allows you to select
      from a list box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Play Count Tag</i><br>
       The play count can now be viewed and updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Drop Pictures</i><br>
       Use drag and drop to add a picture to a song tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pictures in editor</i><br>
       Include a picture frame with the default editor fields to
      make it easier to add pictures to songs that do not have
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tag Backup - extract file parts</i><br>
       Extract and copy parts of files. This enables you to
      combine two or more mp3 files into one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fixed bug in text to speech</i><br>
       An initialization problem caused ptts to exit without
      processing any input when used with windows XP sp2.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Player does not stop when re-sorting</i><br>
       When sorting or shuffling the library or playlist, the
      song currently playing will continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hourglass cursor</i><br>
       Certain long operations now display the hourglass cursor
      to provide feedback that the program is busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Splash page</i><br>
       While jampal is starting up it displays a blank page to
      show that something is happening.
    </p>
