package for Ubuntu -
1. decide where evrything to be installed
   check where tomcat installs, java installs

Open office installs stuff in /usr/share/java/openoffice
jars are in /usr/lib/stuff and /usr/share/something

doc in /usr/share/doc/package

Makefile (no configure script though) that accepts
these standard targets: all (the default), clean, distclean and install.
distclean cleans stuff built by configure
clean cleans stuff build by make
Step 1 - create a Makefile that conforms with this.
Simple programs come with a Makefile file in them and can be compiled simply with 'make'. Some of them support 'make check', which runs included self-checks. Installation to the destination directories is usually done with 'make install'. Now try to compile and run your program, to make sure it works properly and doesn't break something else while it's installing or running. Also, you can usually run 'make clean' (or better 'make distclean') to clean up the build directory. Sometimes there's even a 'make uninstall' which can be used to remove all the installed files.

makefile is called debian/rules 

It must start with the line #!/usr/bin/make -f, so that it can be invoked by saying its name rather than invoking make explicitly. That is, invoking either of make -f debian/rules args... or ./debian/rules args... must result in identical behavior

For targets see debian policy p 24.

freetts - include source and license
Fix it to allow build without freetts - exclude 2 modules
looks - need source or exclude - some are already available in ubuntu
tritonus - license -
GPLv3

GNU standard targets - http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/make/Standard-Targets.html



Create a Makefile in each directory that builds in that directory and installs under DESTDIR
targets - 
all (the default), clean, distclean and install.
Leave zipping source directories for a global script

Put jampal stuff in /usr/share/jampal
jar file
/usr/share/jampal
doc
/usr/share/doc/jampal/html
executable tagbkup
/usr/bin
man for jampal (script), tagbkup, tagupdate (script) 
/usr/share/man/man1
scripts - 
with links cannot use trick for finding the directory
script directory - 
/usr/share/jampal/scripts
ods files - 
/usr/share/jampal/tools
mp3.profile - 
in script dir, also in ~/.jampal also in /etc/jampal, put a default in /etc/jampal this done by the maintainer scripts
clean up the default mp3.profile 
for cygwin - create links from /usr/share to actual directory. setup a script that does this.
to avoid installing a bunch of scripts create a wrapper that calls them based on options.
mp3lib check if files are in a consistent structure
all files need /dir/disk/album/file at least, and disk album and file must be writeable. also consistent - under one disk all files at the same level
step 1 - just jampal, tagbkup, tagupdate

scriptname=`readlink -e "$0"`
scriptpath=`dirname "$scriptname"`

date in RFC2822 or 822 format - 
date -R

copyright in all files.
changelog file
Build must install scripts, html, man
rename scripts jam-upd, jam-org, jam-dups, etc.
mp3lib - checks mentioned above
man pages - jampal, tagbkup, tagupdate, others ?
sort out ${misc:Depends}
Correct classpath for jampal.sh - invoke  java class instead of jar
add classpaths for installable looks
postinst prerm etc - see chap 6 debian policy
use these scripts to install correct jampal option paths for ubuntu in configuration.
move some spreadsheets, examples etc to another directory?

Build source package 
dpkg-buildpackage -S -rfakeroot
It should need my GPG key ?

Build binary package
fakeroot debian/rules binary

for build see debian maint guide p51.

You will see a list of reported bugs against WNPP which you should read to prevent a second report for the same package.

After the buglist you are asked for the request type:

What sort of request is this?

1 ITP This is an "Intent To Package". Please submit a package description
along with copyright and URL in such a report.

Choose the request type: 

After your selection you will be asked for the package name:

Choose the request type: x
Please enter the proposed package name: PACKAGENAME

.If your request type is ITP (1) or RFP (4) you are asked for a short description and then for some information about the package:

Please briefly describe this package; this should be an appropriate short description for the eventual package:

I am packaging Jampal for  Ubuntu. Jampal is an mp3 song library management system and player.  It can
1. Organize a very large library of songs
2. Perform updating of tags, supporting more frames than other systems, also a flexible way of updating large numbers of tags
3. Organize and sort songs according to standard or custom fields
4. Create and play playlists of songs.
5. Voice synthesized song announcements.
6. Transferring playlists to player or disk, optionally with voice announcements.
7. Backup of tags.
Many other capabilities

I have a program (jampal) for playing mp3 files that uses javazoom. javazoom claims to be open source but includes some code (huffcodetab.java) with Davis Pan's name, a copyright notice and a comment that distribution is prohibited. This is causing a problem.  I would like to discuss it.
