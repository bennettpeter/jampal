    <b>Simple text to speech command line program</b> 
    <p>
      This is a very simple Microsoft Windows command line
      program to convert text to speech. If uses the Microsoft
      Text to Speech Engine and the Microsoft Speech SDK. The
      Text to Speech Engine is installed with Windows XP and later versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Linux or CYGWIN installations, there is a script file
      (ptts.sh) which provides everything here but supports many
      speech engines and languages. Run ptts.sh --help to get
      information on it. Note that under Linux the Microsoft
      speech engine will not work, another speech engine must be
      installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text can be keyed in or read from a text file. The
      sound can be output to the computer sound system or sent to
      a wave file. Text is read from standard input or can be
      read from a file using a redirect, for example, to read
      aloud a text file:<br>
       ptts &lt; war-and-peace.txt
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a wav file from the text file (e.g create an
      audio book ;) ):<br>
       ptts -w war-and-peace.wav &lt; war-and-peace.txt
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjust the speech and voice defaults using the speech
      control panel option. Customization of the speech can also
      be performed using XML. If XML is included,
      there must be an XML tag as the first character of the
      text. If you don't need any XML at the start of the text,
      include &lt;&gt; at the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Usage</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Typing the ptts command with -h will list out the available
      options.

      Usage: ptts [options]
